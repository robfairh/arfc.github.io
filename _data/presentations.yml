  description: "Presentation in the MS187 Minisymposium: Statistical mechanics provides a mathematical modeling framework in which a collection of particles (e.g., electrons, nucleons, atoms, or molecules) is represented by a probability density function (PDF). This representation allows one to model the influence of microscopic dynamics on larger scales, without explicitly computing the detailed dynamics on the microscopic scale. Models in this framework are referred to as kinetic models, and arise in many application areas, including in rarefied gas dynamics, nuclear reactor modeling, and plasma physics. Transport phenomena refers to the evolution and redistribution of macroscopic quantities such as mass, momentum, energy, and heat flux. This minisymposium addresses recent advances in computational methods for the simulation of statistical mechanical models and the resulting transport phenomena. Our goal is to showcase a diverse array of application areas, models, and numerical techniques."

  description: "A university research group focused on CSE software development can generate an enormous amount of software very quickly. Not all of it can (or should) be sustained. A constantly increasing maintenance burden is unsustainable and the transient nature of student researchers further complicates software sustainability. However, computational research groups build their research capabilities by leveraging and sustaining software. This poster will summarize lessons learned and challenges encountered by an early career faculty member striking this balance. We will describe software life cycles in the context of the software development workflow, tool stack, and community strategies we use in the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles group. This life cycle will touch on a number of topics, including: software birth/death/afterlife, the various roles of the PI, collaborative code review, skills training, best practices, responsible employment of undergraduates, contribution disambiguation, and contributor transitions."

  description: "The Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles (ARFC) group models and simulates the design, safety, and performance of advanced nuclear reactors. For these simulations coupling between physics such as neutron transport, thermal-hydraulics phenomena, and fuel performance must be taken into account. Our group performs high fidelity simulation of Gen IV reactor designs through development of models and tools for representing unique materials, complex geometries, and physical phenomena. Current work introduces an extension of the MOOSE framework, Moltres, to appropriately model coupled thermal-hydraulics and neutronics of promising liquid-fueled Molten Salt Reactor designs.

Initial simulations of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) have been conducted on Blue Waters supercomputer with deterministic multiphysics. Steady state, transient, and fuel cycle analysis simulations have been run in 2D as well as 3D and compared against the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. These simulations have occupied up to many hundreds of nodes simultaneously and have resulted in rich datasets for use in reactor design and analysis. This talk will describe how coupling between neutronics and thermal hydraulics have been established in the Moltres as well as the validation and verification efforts which have been completed."

First, it is necessary to establish the dynamic evolution of fuel composition via depletion and online reprocessing. Additionally, multiphysics analysis of the thermal hydraulics and neutronics in such a nuclear reactor must incorporate thermal feedbacks and material expansion feedbacks. Finally, drift of delayed neutron precursors must be incorporated into the kinetics analysis due to the mobility of the liquid fuel. This talk will discuss all three components. Toward the first component, a discussion of the SaltProc python package will establish the fuel composition dynamics capabilities necessary for fuel composition depletion in the context of online reprocessing. Toward the second component, a point kinetics model implementation in PyRK, and a more sophisticated advection model implementation in Moltres will be discussed, including neutron diffusion and precursor drift equations in Moltres as well as their implementation using the MOOSE action system. Finally, future directions for Moltres and SaltProc development will be noted."

Such reactors involve tight coupling between physics such as thermal-hydraulic phenomena, neutron transport, and fuel performance. Current work introduces an extension of the MOOSE framework, Moltres, to appropriately model coupled thermal-hydraulics and neutronics of promising molten-salt-fueled reactor designs. Additionally, we have developed an online reprocessing simulation tool, SaltProc which includes fission product removal, fissile material separations, and refuelling for time dependent analysis of fuel-salt evolution. Initial simulations of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment and the conceptual Molten Salt Breeder Reactor have been conducted on Blue Waters with deterministic multiphysics and Monte Carlo methods respectively. Steady state, transient, and fuel cycle analysis simulations have been run in 2D as well as 3D and compared against the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Fuel cycle dynamics and quasi-equilibrium compositions were obtained from depletion and reprocessing simulations for a 20-year time frame. The MSBR full-core safety analysis was performed at the startup and equilibrium fuel salt compositions, for important reactor safety parameters. In this work, conducted on Blue Waters, ARFC has demonstrated the capability to model complex physics in an advanced molten-salt-fueled nuclear reactor."

Insights can be drawn from numerical experiments that model and simulate these systems. Both reactor and nuclear fuel cycle dynamics are sufficiently complex that sophisticated scientific software methods and high-performance computing resources are essential to understanding them. Furthermore, improved reproducibility and verification in these numerical experiments can be achieved through judicious use of scientific computing best practices.  Using examples drawn from spent nuclear fuel management and advanced reactor design,  this talk will describe the role and benefits of modeling and simulation combining insights from multiple scales in nuclear engineering challenges. The talk will introduce Moltres, a new physics application for multiphysics modeling of liquid-fueled molten salt reactors. The neutronics model, thermal hydraulics model, and their coupling in the MOOSE framework will be described. Results for many-channel configurations in 2D-axisymmetric and 3D coordinates will be presented and compared against other coupled models as well as the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment.

These include concepts covered in the paper 'Best Practices in Scientific Computing' (Wilson, et al) as well as concepts covered in 'Effective Computation in Physics' (Scopatz, Huff). It describes a set of practices that are easy to adopt and have proven effective in many research settings. None of these practices will guarantee efficient, error-free software development, but used in concert they will reduce the number of errors in scientific software, make it easier to reuse, and save the authors of the software time and effort that can used for focusing on the underlying scientific questions. This talk will also touch on pain points and lessons learned from a series of case studies of real scientists doing their best, recently published in 'The Practice of Reproducible Research' (Kitzes, Deniz, Turek editors)."

It must accordingly play an essential role in a carbon-reduced sustainable future for our planet. However, it is also somewhat curious, contentious, and complex. This discussion will begin with a brief explanation of the basic physics behind nuclear fission power systems, a synopsis of current and advanced reactor types, and some compelling facts. The remaining majority of the hour will be devoted to an open, ask-me-anything discussion which will thrive on your curiosity, concerns, confusions, and creativity. FAQ include: What about the waste? Can we recycle it? What about meltdowns? Can a reactor become a bomb? Where does plutonium come from? Is radiation natural?  Is thorium magic? When will fusion happen?"

  description: "The world's energy future depends on improved safety and sustainability of nuclear energy. Insights can be drawn from numerical experiments that model and simulate nuclear energy systems, but computational nuclear engineering is sufficiently complex that sophisticated scientific software methods, high-performance computing resources, and data analysis algorithms are essential.  Furthermore, improved reproducibility and verification in these numerical experiments can be achieved only through judicious use of scientific computing best practices.
          This talk will touch on best practices approaches to building software and simulations for computational nuclear engineering. These include concepts covered in the paper 'Best Practices in Scientific Computing' (Wilson, et al) as well as concepts covered in 'Effective Computation in Physics' (Scopatz, Huff). It describes a set of practices that are easy to adopt and have proven effective in many research settings.  None of these practices will guarantee efficient, error-free software development, but used in concert they will reduce the number of errors in scientific software, make it easier to reuse, and save the authors of the software time and effort that can used for focusing on the underlying scientific questions."

It will recite the origins of the steamy long-term relationship between oxide fuel and light water, but will also shed light on both star-crossed and promising pairings between novel fuels, coolants, and moderators. Many strange sagas set in the Idaho desert will be told: tragic tales of youthful experiments (SL-1), hopeful meet-cutes (MSRE), and doomed couplings (ARE). The unique poetry of so-called 'paper reactors' will be touched upon, as will a tantalizing tale of promise: advanced nuclear reactors in the 21st century.

This talk will touch on how my understanding of this need is informed by my own experience as well as work conducted with the Moore-Sloan Reproducibility and Open Science Working Groups at UW, NYU, and UCB. This talk will touch on attempts at many scales to meet the challenge at hand. These will include both failed and successful efforts by myself, my colleagues, organizations such as The Hacker Within and Software Carpentry, and it will also touch on the important contributions of the open source python community.

  description: 'Software is at the heart of modern academic science, but our institutions for education and research are undergoing growing pains concerning the proper care and feeding of software and software developers in the context of academia.

          Conducting open, reproducible, computational science in the domains involves many practical challenges. Leading a software-development-focused research group in academia can be difficult to fund and manage with traditional strategies. Similarly, programs for training students in the domain sciences to become effective computational researchers are rare, immature, untested, or untennable. Research leaders are also faced with challenges in software sustainability and are unprepared to develop the user-developer communities needed to sustain and improve their software in their scientific domain. Finally, efforts to improve the quality of scientific software through top-down pressure are hampered by publication venues (journals, etc.) hesitant to adopt and uphold stricter software quality requirements.

          Software Carpentry, Lab Carpentry, The Hacker Within, and other initiatives are currently lowering the barriers for academics who produce software as part of their research work. However, more effort is needed to support a new generation of computationally fluent research teams.'

One is the development of a book of "reproducible case studies" that we collected from scientists across institutions and scientific disciplines. Each case study is a collection of a researcher’s summary of their most reproducible workflow, their insights about the tools used, the distinct stages of the workflow, the difficulties encountered while making the project more reproducible or replicable, and finally, any noteworthy benefits realized from the use of specific tools or research strategies. The book is intended to be a resource for scientists seeking to learn about potential best practices and processes that they might use toward reproducibility in their own work. This talk will review what we discovered through this process, including insights about researcher workflows, pain points, incentives, and human challenges.'

  description: 'This talk will discuss progress using various approaches to coupled physics analysis of reactor transients in Fluoride Salt Cooled High Temperature Reactors (FHRs), with particular focus on the Pebble-Bed, Fluoride Salt Cooled, High Temperature Reactor (PB-FHR). These have evolved from algebraic and 0-D models to more comprehensive 3D models. Development of steady state benchmarks for FHR simulation will be touched upon, as will challenges encountered in conducting benchmark comparisons among software of differing capabilities in this arena. The development and implementation of an incompressible but thermally expandable model of salt flow through the pebble bed will be discussed as well, in the context of implementation within the MOOSE framework.'

  description: "The world's energy future depends on improved safety and sustainability of nuclear reactor designs and fuel cycle strategies. Insights can be drawn from numerical experiments that model and simulate these systems. Both reactor and nuclear fuel cycle dynamics are sufficiently complex that sophisticated scientific software methods, high-performance computing resources, and data analysis algorithms are essential to improving our understanding of them. Furthermore, improved reproducibility and verification in these numerical experiments can be achieved through judicious use of scientific computing best practices. This talk will touch on best practices approaches to building software and simulations for coupled physics analysis of reactor transients in the Pebble-Bed, Fluoride Salt Cooled, High Temperature Reactor (PB-FHR) as well as Cyclus, the agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework."

  description: 'Detailed computational models, massively parallelized calculations, and enormously collaborative simulation projects are increasingly integral to the advancement of science. However, the caliber of this work is limited by a workforce lacking formal training in essential software development skills. To address this unmet need, a number of initiatives (e.g. Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry) have developed online resources and led short courses addressing software development best practices such as version control and test driven code development, as well as basic skills such as UNIX mobility. With the exception of the Software Carpentry Drivers License for High Performance Computing, however, these initiatives stop just shy of parallelization concepts and skills, and their scalability and sustainability is further limited by the volunteer power on which they run.

The challenge at hand will only be sustainably solved when best practices in research-grade scientific computing have penetrated the traditional science and engineering curriculum in universities. This talk will describe a new effort to embed best practices for reproducible, application-focused, research-grade scientific computing into traditional university curriculum. In particular, a set of open source, liberally licensed, IPython (now Jupyter) notebooks are being developed and tested to accompany a book “Effective Computation in Physics: A Field Guide to Research in Python.” These interactive lecture materials lay out in-class exercises for a project-driven university course and are accordingly intended to be forked, modified and reused by professors across universities and disciplines. With Python as a teaching language, this course prepares university students for research at scale by approaching practical scientific computing challenges such as data structures, performant simulation design, hierarchical data storage, parallelization, analysis, and visualization.'

  description: 'Detailed computational models, massively parallelized calculations, and enormously collaborative simulation projects are increasingly integral to the advancement of science. However, the caliber of this work is limited by a workforce lacking formal training in a reproducible, transparent, software development skill suite that is becoming increasingly essential. To address this unmet need, a number of initiatives (e.g. Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and The Hacker Within) have developed online resources, led short courses, and nurtured local communities addressing software development best practices such as version control and test driven code development, as well as basic skills such as UNIX mobility. In addition to unique contributions such as a Drivers License for High Performance Computing, Software Carpentry conducts workshops at research institutions around the world. These workshops seek to provide time efﬁcient introductions to essential programming languages and tools without turning “biochemists and mechanical engineers into computer scientists”. The Hacker Within similarly nurtures a peer-driven community for scientific computing skill sharing. It does so through regular meetings in a few local chapters around the world, including one at the University of Illinois.

The scalability and sustainability of these initiatives, however, is limited by the volunteer power on which they run, so their challenge will only be sustainably solved when best practices in scientific computing have penetrated the traditional science and engineering curriculum in universities. This talk will describe one new effort to embed best practices for reproducible scientific computing into traditional university curriculum. In particular, a set of open source, liberally licensed, IPython (now Jupyter) notebooks are being developed and tested to accompany a book “Effective Computation in Physics.” These interactive lecture materials lay out in-class exercises for a project-driven upper-level undergraduate course and are accordingly intended to be forked, modified and reused by professors across universities and disciplines.'
