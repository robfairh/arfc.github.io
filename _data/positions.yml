      description: 'Even if direct funding for a new postdoctoral opening is not available in the ARFC group, applications from exceptional postdoctoral researchers, especially those with their own source of funding, will always be considered. The ideal postdoctoral researcher for ARFC would be interested in spending 1-3 years at UofI. A background in nuclear engineering, fuel cycles, reactor physics, and computing will be essential. Such researchers should be interested in conducting research that is in synergy with the mission of the research group as a whole.'

              Under general supervision of the principal investigators, the candidate will work as part of a team implementing physics kernels and applications within the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) Finite Element Modeling (FEM) ecosystem. These kernels and simulations will extend current modeling capabilities to include models appropriate for the unique physics encountered in advanced reactor simulation. As much as possible, this work will be conducted in a transparent and open manner, with an emphasis on maximizing reproducibility and reuse potential. Accordingly, this work will leverage literate programming tools (e.g. Jupyter notebooks) as a platform for communicating analysis methods and results."
      required: "PhD in nuclear engineering, physics, mechanical engineering, applied mathematics, computer science or closely related discipline. Significant experience in C++ programming. Significant experience in python programming. Strong mathematical background. Strong interest in advanced reactors and systems.  Strong written communication skills. A commitment to and demonstrated ability to perform collaborative research in an interdisciplinary team environment. A demonstrated capability to utilize high performance computing resources.  Demonstrated experience in analyzing simulation results."

We seek a student who will implement a lightweight location data attribute to enrich Agent class objects in the Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework. The student will implement necessary unit tests, add documentation, and demonstrate the rich use of this attribute in existing models. Ideally, the student will work with our team to prepare a conference paper or journal article on this benchmark result. Though learning through doing is integral to this effort, applicants must be comfortable in UNIX/Linux environments and should have some knowledge of C++. Applicants with experience using SQL, HDF5, XML, and Python will be preferred.

We seek a student to set up and conduct Cyclus simulations that accurately predict and simulate the history of nuclear energy. Starting at the dawn of commercial nuclear power, the student will define the initial conditions and deployment of reactors as they were deployed historically using what we know (wikidata, IAEA records, etc.) to approximate operating histories, deployment rules, power consumption growth rates, and other details. This simulation should approximate as closely as possible the true history of nuclear power deployment and arrive at what we know to be the existing stored fuel inventory.
