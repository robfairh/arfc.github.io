(or your project description if you are doing
your own research).

For the project description, there is a general template
below that has been used by people that obtained their
license:

```markdown
I am a graduate student in the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles group at the University
of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, which is led by Prof. Kathryn Huff.
My research is funded by _______. My use of Serpent will contribute to _______.
I intend to use Serpent to _______. In the near term, this work will _______.
This work will contribute to my thesis work in _______. Data and software management
in this work will abide by all license guidelines and will be informed
by the export control officer at the University of Illinois.
```

Here is an example where the blanks have been filled in:

```markdown
I am a graduate student in the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles group at the University
of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, which is led by Prof. Kathryn Huff.
My research is funded by a graduate fellowship from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
My use of Serpent will contribute to the licensing and regulatory mission of the U.S. NRC
through investigation of advanced nuclear reactor safety. I intend to use Serpent
to run neutronics simulations of advanced reactor types relevant to the future
of the US nuclear energy system. In the near term, this work will emphasize generation
of group constants supporting safety analysis of Molten Salt Reactor core designs.
This work will contribute to my thesis work in advanced reactor multi-physics methods
for safety analysis and design optimization. Data and software management in this work
will abide by all license guidelines and will be informed by the export control officer
at the University of Illinois.
```
