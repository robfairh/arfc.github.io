<p>I look forward to speaking with you virtually or in person.</p>

<h1 id="when">When</h1>

<p>If you are a student in my class, you should meet with me during my stated
office hours for that course.</p>

<p>For everyone else: here’s a url where you can pick a time and place that works for you:
<a href="http://katyhuff.youcanbook.me">katyhuff.youcanbook.me</a>. It syncs with my
calendar. Once you’ve filled it out, we’ll both receive an email that confirms
the details.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If it’s 5 minutes, try dropping by my office.</li>
  <li>If it’s 15 minutes, schedule me for a 15 minute meeting.</li>
  <li>If it’s 30 minutes, schedule me for a 30 minute meeting and come very prepared.</li>
  <li>If it’s longer than 30 minutes, are you sure?</li>
</ul>

<p>I look forward to meeting with you. I am always open to discuss new ideas with
colleagues, group members, students, and potential collaborators. My office
door is often open for this reason.  However, please be aware that I
think my office hours work most effectively if I arrive prepared. To get the
most out of your time with me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Send a concise written description of the topic or question (a couple of paragraphs by email) at least a day or two before meeting.</li>
  <li>If you are coming to me with a programming conundrum, please see this <a href="/manual/guides/katy/codereq">guide</a> before setting up a meeting</li>
  <li>If you would like to discuss data or theory, I recommend bringing ample diagrams, figures, and tables to our meeting for discussion.</li>
  <li>Like other humans, I usually need advance time to review something. See this <a href="/manual/guides/katy/revreq">guide</a> on that topic.</li>
</ul>
