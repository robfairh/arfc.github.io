This page is an index of the growing set of guides behind the operations of the
research group. It is intended to be a living document capturing the overviews
and checklists for mastering the practical, administrative, and computational
infrastructure that ARFC relies on for various common tasks. All research group
members should contribute to this section early and often. If possible, link to
GitHub repositories, gists, or Jupyter notebooks when there is a guide item
that can be captured in one.
