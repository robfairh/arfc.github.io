        <title>Jin Whan Bae Recognized for Outstanding Undergraduate Research</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ARFC graduate student, &lt;strong&gt;Jin Whan Bae&lt;/strong&gt;, Teddy for short, will be recognized this 
month with the &lt;strong&gt;2017 Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering Outstanding 
Undergraduate Research Award.&lt;/strong&gt;  Teddy has been invited to attend the Department 
Honors and Awards Banquet on April 13th, where he will formally receive his 
award.  This recognition consists of a monetary award, a certificate, and a 
listing on a plaque that is permanently displayed in Talbot Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2016, Teddy was an undergraduate researcher in ARFC. This semester he
is completing his undergraduate degree while beginning his first semester as a
graduate student in ARFC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is being recognized for his significant achievements in research as an
undergraduate. In particular, in Fall 2016, Teddy led a project to quantify the
feasibility, benefits, and drawbacks of a creative disposal concept.  For this
work, Teddy consulted technically with Prof. Huff as well as key NPRE experts, 
Dr. William  Roy and Prof. Cliff Singer. This work culminated in a paper 
submission to the International High-Level Radioactive Waste Management 
Conference (IHLRWM2017).  This paper, “Benefits of Siting a Borehole Repository 
on Non-Operating Nuclear Facility,” was exceptional work and was 
enthusiastically accepted.  Expert reviewers said about this paper “Wonderful 
paper! Publish basically as is.” and “This is an excellent paper that maps out 
an entirely plausible new way to look at nuclear waste storage in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students. We especially congratulate 
Teddy on this award as it recognizes a core value of our research group: 
exceptional scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kathryn Mummah Rakes in Awards</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Senior ARFC undergraduate Kathryn Mummah, Katie for short, has recently received 
honors from the Roy G. Post Foundation as well as a Knights of St. Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is the University of Illinois’ first recipient of a Roy G. Post Foundation 
undergraduate scholarship and has been invited to attend the Waste Management 
Symposium in Arizona, March 5-9, in order to receive her award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when The Knights of St. Patrick of the University of Illinois 
announced their award recipients (by covertly decorating the Grainger Library 
with St. Patrick’s Day ephemera), Katie was among the short list of 2017 
honorees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students and we congratulate 
Katie on both of these awards which give, in their own way, special recognition 
of her outstanding record of service and academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Group Members Join ARFC</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the first semester of the ARFC group begins this fall, I’m excited to 
announce that a number of researchers will join the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexander Lindsay will be joining us a postdoctoral scholar. He received his
undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Washington
and received his PhD this summer from North Carolina State University. He will
be joining ARFC as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/&quot;&gt;Data Exploration Laboratory
(DXL)&lt;/a&gt; led by Matthew Turk. His activities will
emphasize open source advanced reactor multiphysics and his collaboration with
DXL may advance visual exploration of simulation results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrei Rykhlevskii will be joining the group as a PhD student. He has a degree
in Nuclear Engineering from Bauman Moscow State Technical University as well as
a Masters of Science in Finanace from the Financial University in Moscow. His
work will likely also emphasize open source advanced reactor multiphysics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a small team of undergraduate researchers will join the group 
this year.  These include Kathryn Mummah and Jin Whan Bae of NPRE as well as 
Matthew Worley and Yukun Tan who will join us through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/&quot;&gt;NCSA 
SPIN&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of all of these researchers, I expect ARFC will really be able to
hit the ground running.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ARFC and ERGS Receive NEUP R&amp;D Award</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The United State Department of Energy &lt;a href=&quot;https://neup.inl.gov/Lists/Headlines/AnnouncementDispForm.aspx?ID=134&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; today that ARFC, in collaboration with the University of South Carolina’s Energy and Resources Group led by Anthony Scopatz 
(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ergs.sc.edu/&quot;&gt;ERGS&lt;/a&gt;), would recieve 3 years of NEUP R&amp;amp;D support. The 
ARFC group will be able to support extensive work on predictive deployment 
models for the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator and its library of available 
modules, Cycamore. The abstract for this award, 
“Demand Driven Cycamore Archetypes” can be 
found

        <title>Huff Plans to Join NPRE</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am thrilled to be joining the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as 
an Assistant Professor in the Department of Nuclear, Plasma and Radiological 
Engineering. I was honored to have been awarded a Blue Waters Assistant 
Professorship as well as an affiliate faculty appointment with the National 
Center for Supercomputing Applications. The support of NCSA is very meaningful 
to me and I hope to make important use of the high performance computing 
resources on campus when I arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will begin my appointment on August 16, 2016. Until then, I’ll be wrapping up 
my work at the University of California, Berkeley. In addition, I’ll be 
preparing my first NPRE course, seeking graduate students and postdocs for a 
research group, finding a home in the Urbana-Champaign area, and setting up 
this website.&lt;/p&gt;
