        <title>Two ARFC Graduate Students Recognized with ANS Scholarships</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two ARFC graduate students, &lt;strong&gt;Andrei Rykhlevskii&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Anshuman Chaube&lt;/strong&gt; were 
recognized this year by the American Nuclear Society at the national level with 
the &lt;strong&gt;2018 John and Muriel Landis Scholarship.&lt;/strong&gt; This award, given by the ANS 
NEED Committee, consists of a monetary award, a certificate, and placement in 
the online archive of recipients on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ans.org/honors/scholarships/recipients/&quot;&gt;ANS honors and awards 
website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This award recognizes students with exceptional potential in nuclear science and 
engineering who also pursue graduate school despite greater than average 
constraints. We applaud the committee’s selection of these two students. They 
each have chosen to pursue their graduate degrees in the face of all challenges 
presented to them. They each hold extraordinary promise as future nuclear 
engineering researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrei joined ARFC in Fall 2016, and has made significant achievements in 
graduate research. He has successfully passed his qualifying exam and this 
semester he completed his MS degree. We are thrilled that he intends to 
continue toward his PhD in nuclear engineering. Andrei’s research work focuses 
on high performance multi-physics modeling and simulation and fuel cycle 
analysis of the molten salt breeder reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ansh joined ARFC in Fall 2017 and is already working toward two compelling 
projects. First, he is building a computational model of energy generation and 
consumption in Japan and is working toward dynamic transition analyses of a 
reduced carbon future. This work is supported as part of the I2CNER 
collaboration.  Additionally, Ansh has begun neutronics analysis in support of 
future multi-physics simulations of the Transatomic Power Reactor design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students and we are particularly 
delighted to congratulate Andrei and Ansh on this award. It recognizes 
something of great importance to our mission : the humanity and dedication 
required to pursue an advanced degree in nuclear engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gyu Tae Park Recognized for Outstanding Undergraduate Research</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/people/parkg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gyu Tae Park&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARFC undergraduate student, &lt;strong&gt;Gyu Tae Park&lt;/strong&gt;, Jack for short, was recognized this 
month with the &lt;strong&gt;2018 Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering Outstanding 
Undergraduate Research Award.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gyu Tae accepted the award at the NPRE Department 
Honors and Awards Banquet on April 19th.
This recognition consists of a monetary award, a certificate, and a 
listing on a plaque that is permanently displayed in Talbot Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2016, Gyu Tae joined the group as an undergraduate researcher in ARFC. 
This semester he is completing his undergraduate degree. Upon graduation, he 
will return to South Korea to complete his military obligation. We hope he 
will return to Illinois some time in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gyu Tae is being recognized for his significant achievements in research as an 
undergraduate. In particular, he led a project to incorporate geospatial 
information into the Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator. This work resulted in 
analytical mapping capabilities which will be very valuable in years to come.&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, Gyu Tae collaborated with other students in incorporating a 
wealth of data from the IAEA PRIS database into formats appropriate for use in 
the Cyclus simulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students. We especially congratulate 
Gyu Tae on this award as it recognizes a core value of our research group: 
excellence in scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bae Presents Poster at GLOBAL 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ARFC graduate student, &lt;strong&gt;Jin Whan Bae&lt;/strong&gt;, Teddy for short, travelled to Seoul, 
South Korea in September to present a poster at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.global2017.org/&quot;&gt;GLOBAL 2017 Nuclear Fuel 
cycle Conference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His poster, titled “Current Status of Predictive Transition Capability in Fuel 
Cycle Simulation,” was accompanied by a conference paper of the same name. It 
established the state of the art of predictive fuel cycle facility deployment 
in exising nuclear fuel cycle simulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bae said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Thanks to ARFC, I was able to network with professionals and academics
worldwide in my field. I think the experience and things I learned in the
conference will help me greatly in my research and my career.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Andrei Rykhlevskii Recognized with ANS Scholarship</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Second year ARFC graduate student, &lt;strong&gt;Andrei Rykhlevskii&lt;/strong&gt;, was recognized this year by the 
American Nuclear Society at the national level with a &lt;strong&gt;2017 John and Muriel 
Landis Scholarship.&lt;/strong&gt; This award, given by the ANS NEED Committee,
consists of a monetary award, a certificate, and placement in 
the online archive of recipients on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ans.org/honors/scholarships/recipients/&quot;&gt;ANS honors and awards 
website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This award recognizes students with exceptional potential in nuclear science 
and engineering who also pursue graduate school despite greater than average 
financial constraints. We applaud the committee’s selection of Andrei, who is 
simultaneously an exceptionally promising graduate student, a husband, and a 
father of two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrei joined ARFC in Fall 2016, and has already made significant achievements 
in graduate research.  In particular, Andrei has completed a full 
core neutronic model of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor with unprecedented 
geometric detail. Additionally, he conducted an accompanying online fuel 
reprocessing analysis for that reactor.  For this work, Andrei consulted 
technically with Prof. Huff as well as the larger Serpent 2 neutronics 
simulation community. His dedication has resulted in a strong foundation for 
future multi-physics and fuel cycle analysis of molten salt breeder
reactor designs more broadly. This work culminated in two conference paper 
submissions to the 2017 American Nuclear Society Winter Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students and we are particularly 
delighted to congratulate Andrei on this award. It recognizes something of 
great importance to our mission : the humanity and dedication required to 
pursue an advanced degree in nuclear engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jin Whan Bae Recognized for Outstanding Undergraduate Research</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ARFC graduate student, &lt;strong&gt;Jin Whan Bae&lt;/strong&gt;, Teddy for short, will be recognized this 
month with the &lt;strong&gt;2017 Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering Outstanding 
Undergraduate Research Award.&lt;/strong&gt;  Teddy has been invited to attend the Department 
Honors and Awards Banquet on April 13th, where he will formally receive his 
award.  This recognition consists of a monetary award, a certificate, and a 
listing on a plaque that is permanently displayed in Talbot Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2016, Teddy was an undergraduate researcher in ARFC. This semester he
is completing his undergraduate degree while beginning his first semester as a
graduate student in ARFC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is being recognized for his significant achievements in research as an
undergraduate. In particular, in Fall 2016, Teddy led a project to quantify the
feasibility, benefits, and drawbacks of a creative disposal concept.  For this
work, Teddy consulted technically with Prof. Huff as well as key NPRE experts, 
Dr. William  Roy and Prof. Cliff Singer. This work culminated in a paper 
submission to the International High-Level Radioactive Waste Management 
Conference (IHLRWM2017).  This paper, “Benefits of Siting a Borehole Repository 
on Non-Operating Nuclear Facility,” was exceptional work and was 
enthusiastically accepted.  Expert reviewers said about this paper “Wonderful 
paper! Publish basically as is.” and “This is an excellent paper that maps out 
an entirely plausible new way to look at nuclear waste storage in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students. We especially congratulate 
Teddy on this award as it recognizes a core value of our research group: 
exceptional scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kathryn Mummah Rakes in Awards</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Senior ARFC undergraduate Kathryn Mummah, Katie for short, has recently received 
honors from the Roy G. Post Foundation as well as a Knights of St. Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is the University of Illinois’ first recipient of a Roy G. Post Foundation 
undergraduate scholarship and has been invited to attend the Waste Management 
Symposium in Arizona, March 5-9, in order to receive her award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when The Knights of St. Patrick of the University of Illinois 
announced their award recipients (by covertly decorating the Grainger Library 
with St. Patrick’s Day ephemera), Katie was among the short list of 2017 
honorees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARFC is lucky to have an accomplished group of students and we congratulate 
Katie on both of these awards which give, in their own way, special recognition 
of her outstanding record of service and academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Group Members Join ARFC</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the first semester of the ARFC group begins this fall, I’m excited to 
announce that a number of researchers will join the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexander Lindsay will be joining us a postdoctoral scholar. He received his
undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Washington
and received his PhD this summer from North Carolina State University. He will
be joining ARFC as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/&quot;&gt;Data Exploration Laboratory
(DXL)&lt;/a&gt; led by Matthew Turk. His activities will
emphasize open source advanced reactor multiphysics and his collaboration with
DXL may advance visual exploration of simulation results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrei Rykhlevskii will be joining the group as a PhD student. He has a degree
in Nuclear Engineering from Bauman Moscow State Technical University as well as
a Masters of Science in Finanace from the Financial University in Moscow. His
work will likely also emphasize open source advanced reactor multiphysics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a small team of undergraduate researchers will join the group 
this year.  These include Kathryn Mummah and Jin Whan Bae of NPRE as well as 
Matthew Worley and Yukun Tan who will join us through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/&quot;&gt;NCSA 
SPIN&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of all of these researchers, I expect ARFC will really be able to
hit the ground running.&lt;/p&gt;
